abstract = {The aim of this work was to identify comparable markets for the hotel industry in Europe and to compare the fees incurred by hotels for using copyrighted and indirect rights for copyright management organizations. The study covers 21 European countries. Using multivariate statistical analysis methods, these countries were grouped, taking into account gross domestic product per capita and the average daily rate for a hotel room. A detailed comparison of the fees that hotels pay for using music and audiovisual works was conducted for the Central and Eastern European countries characterized by the lowest income and hotel prices. The analysis identified wide variation in the methods for calculating fees, fee amounts, and the relationship to hotel revenues among the various countries.},
