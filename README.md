## Document Templates
`docsx/` - templat for rendering into a Word document.

## Program files

## OPA Open Materials

From the [Open Policy Analysis Guidelines](http://www.bitss.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OPA-Guidelines.pdf):

- Label and document each input, including data, research, and guesswork: see contents of documents.

- Standardize the file structure so that materials are organized in a way that is accessible to an informed reader: see below folder documentation.

- Ensure that code/spreadsheets are reproducible. 

- All research and innovation team members use version control software and track changes in a shared project repository. It is clear who contributed to the research, when, and who approved or rejected the contribution.
